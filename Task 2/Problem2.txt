Pseudocode for Fibonacci series

For printing fibonacci series,we initialize starting numbers
0 and 1 and add the consecutive numbers inside while loop
which executes till the limit given by user.

Pseudocode:

Step 1: Start
Step 2: Declare variable a,b,sum,n,i  
Step 3: Initialize variable a=0, b=1,sum=0, i=2  
Step 4: Input n from user  
Step 5: Print a and b 
 
Step 6: 
while i<=n           
     sum=a+b           
     a=b, b=sum    
     i=i+1
     print sum 

Step 7: Stop
