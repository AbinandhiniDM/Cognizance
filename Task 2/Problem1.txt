Pseudocode for Checking whether the given number is divisible by 3 or not without using modulo operator

For this the idea is to keep on subtracting the given number
by 3 before it becomes negative, if it is 0 then the number 
is divisible by 3 else it is not divisible by 3.

Pseudocode:

Step 1: Start
Step 2: Declare variable n,a
Step 3: Input n from user
Step 4: a=n

Step 5: 
while n>0
    n=n-3

Step 6: 
if n==0
     print "the number is divisible by 3"
else 
     print "the number is not divisible by 3"

Step 8: stop
